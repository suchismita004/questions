### How can you validate your email?
- **Email validation** can be done using regular expressions (regex) to ensure the format is correct and by sending a confirmation email with a verification link.

### Hashing and Encryption
- **Hashing**: Converts data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a digest that cannot be reversed.
- **Encryption**: Transforms data into a different format, protecting it from unauthorized access, and can be decrypted back to the original data.

### Differentiate between Hashing and Encryption
- **Hashing**: One-way process, used for data integrity checks. Example: SHA-256.
- **Encryption**: Two-way process, used for data confidentiality. Example: AES (symmetric), RSA (asymmetric).

### Symmetric and Asymmetric Algorithms
- **Symmetric Algorithms**: Same key for encryption and decryption. Faster. Example: AES.
- **Asymmetric Algorithms**: Different keys for encryption (public key) and decryption (private key). More secure. Example: RSA.

### Which is faster, React or JS?
- **JavaScript (JS)** is the base language and can be faster for small tasks.
- **React** is a library built on JS and is optimized for building and updating user interfaces efficiently, but adds overhead compared to vanilla JS.

### How Git Init Actually Works
- **Git Init**: Creates a new Git repository by initializing a .git directory in the specified folder, setting up the necessary structure for version control.

### Indexing, Session, and Cookies
- **Indexing**: Technique used by databases to improve query performance.
- **Session**: Server-side storage of user data to persist state across requests.
- **Cookies**: Client-side storage of user data, sent with each HTTP request to the server.

### What if they disabled Encryption
- **Disabling Encryption**: Would expose data to potential interception and unauthorized access, compromising confidentiality and security.

### Hashing and Types
- **Hashing**: Process of converting data into a fixed-size hash value. Types include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-3.

These summaries provide a quick overview of the concepts and their differences.



### Git vs GitHub
#### Can we use GitHub without Git?
- **No**, GitHub is designed to work with Git, the version control system. While you can browse repositories on GitHub and download files, to fully utilize GitHubâ€™s features like cloning, pushing, and pulling, you need Git.

### Decryption and Encryption
- **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to protect data.
- **Decryption**: The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a key.

### Which technique is used in WhatsApp, encryption or hashing, and why?
- **Encryption**: WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to ensure that only the communicating users can read the messages. This protects the confidentiality of the messages from being accessed by unauthorized parties.

### Salt, Cookies vs Session
- **Salt**: Random data added to passwords before hashing to ensure unique hash outputs.
- **Cookies**: Small pieces of data stored on the client-side and sent with HTTP requests to maintain state.
- **Session**: Server-side storage of user data to persist state across multiple requests.

### Can we use Session without Cookies?
- **Yes**, sessions can be managed without cookies by embedding session identifiers in URLs or hidden form fields, though this is less common and can have security and usability issues.
